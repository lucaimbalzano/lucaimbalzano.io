## Bits of Me

Â Â 
I am passionate Software Engineer with several years of experience in building scalable and efficient software solutions. Based in Milan, I specialize in full-stack development, cloud computing, and DevOps, with expertise in Java, TypeScript, NestJS, React, SQL, Python, and System Design Â .

I love exploring open-source projects, tackling algorithm challenges, and optimizing complex systems. Throughout my career, I have worked on real estate automation, e-commerce platforms, fintech solutions, and telecommunications software, contributing to startups and enterprises alike.

Beyond coding, I enjoy reverse engineering, web scraping, and system architecture, constantly pushing the boundaries of technology. This blog is my space to share insights, projects, and lessons learnedâ€”letâ€™s build and grow together! ðŸš€
